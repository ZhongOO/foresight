**"The virtue of maps, they show what can be done with limited space, they foresee that everything can happen therein."                                                                                                                                                                                                             - Jose Saramago**

Foresight is an app that uses the Google maps API and creates markers that convey the accessibility features available in a building so that specially-abled people can prepare in advance when they have to visit a place they haven't been to. It will rely on contributors, similar to Google Local Guides to update the data for the building. Through gamification, we can provide an incentive for contributors to populate the map with places and update the information, gaining points and levelling up along the way.

Information about accessible facilities such as the following will be available:
* Entrances
* Elevators,
* Toilets
* Parking spaces
* Navigation

For older buildings and architecture, especially in cities, retrofitting and modifications can be more difficult to implement. Around the world, accessibilty laws vary widely by country. Hence, for people with disabilities, the extra information can go a long way.
